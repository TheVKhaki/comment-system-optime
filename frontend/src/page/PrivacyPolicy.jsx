          service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and
          use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other
          non-marketing purposes.

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.

          can match the information you provide with the information we already
          have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method

          We will only use personal information provided in your request to

          your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
          delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish
